# FreedomGame
Freedom is a board game where you try to make as many sets of three Xs or Os on the board as possible. This is all done while placing your X or O adjacent to your opponents X or O, unless there are no more spots adjacent to your opponent then you have the freedom to place your X or O where ever you want on the board. Once all the spots on the board are filled the score is calculated by adding up all of the sets of three Xs or Os for each player and the player with the most sets of three Xs or Os wins!!!
